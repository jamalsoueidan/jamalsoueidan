### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Frontend consulting is what I do! Angular and React, and this is a profile. 

There are numerous showcase/example Angular and React projects available in my repository. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Booking Shopify Application

To build the Booking Shopify Application, I needed to deploy a docker image on Heroku, use the Shopify API with graphQL to integrate my application with Shopify, create Liquid pages to generate the booking form on the storefront (Shopify Extentions), and build two applications, one for the [internal Shopify admin](https://github.com/jamalsoueidan/booking-shopify-embed-app) section and another for [the staff](https://github.com/jamalsoueidan/booking-shopify-external-app). Both applications are built with express nodejs web application framework for backend api's and vite for frontend tooling, react is used to develop the frontend applications in both applications, and shopify polaris is used to build the ui, and [bit.dev](https://bit.cloud/jamalsoueidan/bsf) to maintain and [share components](https://github.com/jamalsoueidan/booking-shopify-framework) in both applications, MongoDB for the backend DB with mongoose to model my application data and query building, business logic.
